**IE6 WEB DEVELOPER WANTED**

## Developement

See `package.json` for build and test instruction

### Requirement

- Windows (This project is somehow Windows only, because of JScript)
- Node.js (with NPM)
- [JavaScriptShell]
- Visual Studio (because of JScript debugging)
- VSCode is suggested

### About test

No existing test framework met my requirement(running on JScript engines, has TypeScript support), so I built one.
