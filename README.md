# PACFW

**IE6 WEB DEVELOPER WANTED**

Modified from xtons' [smart-pac]

## Developement

See `package.json` for build and test instruction

### Requirement

-   Windows (This project is somehow Windows only, because of JScript)
-   Node.js (with NPM)
-   [JavaScriptShell]
-   Visual Studio (because of JScript debugging)
-   VSCode is suggested

### About test

No existing test framework met my requirement(running on JScript engines, has TypeScript support), so I built one.
